## Project Description:
- Ceramic Subframe Spacers - 6x10mm M4x0.7mm
- Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
- Lower Thermal expansion than Zirconia
- Thermal Conductivity @ RT 2.2 W/mK
- Max use tempature 500Â°C
- Tougher than Zirconia
- "This material offers the highest flexural strength of all Zirconia based materials." (AKA won't crack when you tighten down the screws)
- Because ceramic screws $$$

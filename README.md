# Jalopy-3D-Printer
The Jalopy is a custom remix of the ender 3. Just seeing where this project takes me and where I end up.

## Project Goals:

- Significantly Reduce overall print time

- Increase Speed/Acceleration

- Reduce weight of moving components

- Increase weight of the nonmoving components

- Increase Stiffness of the frame

- Reduce vibration

- Maintain or increase overall print quality

- Take no prisoners!

- Have fun!



## Custom Components:

Infared Halogen Heaters - Hotend
- [Dual Ignition System](https://github.com/Leviathan3DPrinting/Dual-Ignition-System) - 2 20W G4 halogen bulbs (only tested for safety!

Infared Halogen Heater - Bed
- Seat Warmers - 2 250W T3 halogen bulbs (unyet tested!)

Bed
- [Carbon Fiber Bonnet](https://github.com/Leviathan3DPrinting/Jalopy-3D-Printer/tree/ad34be1e4e56d2a3a7dab663aaee73733993598e/Custom%20High%20Performance%20Parts/Carbon%20Fiber%20Bonnet) - 240mmx240mmx3mm Carbon Fiber Bed

Bed Heater
- [Engine Compartment Heater](https://github.com/Leviathan3DPrinting/Jalopy-3D-Printer/blob/ad34be1e4e56d2a3a7dab663aaee73733993598e/Custom%20High%20Performance%20Parts/Engine%20Compartment%20Heater) - 225W Kapton Heater (Just Beautiful!)

Bed Spacers
- Subframe Spacers - 6x10mm M4x0.7mm Alumina Toughened Zirconia (10% Al2O3)
  - Lowest Thermal expansion than Zirconia
  - One of the lowest thermal conductivity ratings of any ceramic 20 W/mK
  - Tougher than Zirconia
  - Because ceramic screws $$$

Frame
- Chassis - Custom Frame
  - Parts fit oiginal Ender 3 frame with modification (Modified panels for Ender 3 have been made!)

Extrusion Fillers
- Chassis Weights - printed housings filled with polymeric sand
  - Great way to add mass to any printer!

Screws
- Fastners - All that sexy titanium hardware!

### Off the shelf!

Mainboard
- The King of Memphis! - Fystec Spider King


Y Motor Mounts
- AWD Y - Dual LDO [INSERT MODEL NUMBER]


TODO:
- A HELLUVALOTTAWORK!

## Project Goals:

- Significantly Reduce overall print time

- Maintain or increase overall print quality

- Increase Speed/Acceleration

- Reduce vibration

- Reduce weight of moving components

- Increase weight of the nonmoving components

- Increase Stiffness of the frame

- Multiple Configurations (Mix and Match!)

- Show off how fast you can print [taulman3D Carbon Fiber Alloy Nylon 3D Printer Filament!](https://taulman3d.com/carbonfiberalloynylonfilament.html)

- Print PEEK no enclosure!

- Take no prisoners!

- Have fun!

# Jalopy-3D-Printer
The Jalopy is a custom remix of the ender 3. Just seeing where this project takes me and where I end up.

# Project Goals:

- Significantly Reduce overall print time

- Increase Speed/Acceleration

- Reduce weight of moving components

- Increase weight of the nonmoving components

- Increase Stiffness of the frame

- Reduce vibration

- Maintain or increase overall print quality

- Take no prisoners!

- Have fun!



## Custom Components:

Infared Halogen Heaters - Hotend
- Dual Ignition System - 2 20W G4 halogen bulbs (only tested for safety!)

Infared Halogen Heater - Bed
- Seat Warmers - 2 250W T3 halogen bulbs (unyet tested!)

Bed
- Carbon Fiber Bonnet - 240mmx240mmx3mm Carbon Fiber Bed (unyet tested!)
  - 42% Lighter than the aluminum bed
  - Way better looking!
  - More pronounced resonance (could just be the cheap plate)
  - Mounting holes for strain relief or cable chain
  - Mounting holes for ADXL345

Bed Heater
- Engine Compartment Heater - 225W Kapton Heater (Just Beautiful!)
  - Extremely lightweight compared to the original aluminum bed heater
  - Better Looking than the original bed heater
  - Just damn good looking

Bed Spacers
- Subframe Spacers - 6x10mm M4x0.7mm Alumina Toughened Zirconia (10% Al2O3)
  - Lowest Thermal expansion than Zirconia
  - One of the lowest thermal conductivity ratings of any ceramic 20 W/mK
  - Tougher than Zirconia
  - Because ceramic screws $$$

Frame
- Chassis - Custom Frame
  - Parts fit oiginal Ender 3 frame with modification (Modified panels for Ender 3 have been made!)

Extrusion Fillers
- Chassis Weights - printed housings filled with polymeric sand
  - Great way to add mass to any printer!

Screws
- Fastners - All that sexy titanium hardware!
